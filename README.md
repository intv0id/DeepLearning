Deep Learning Course Labs - Eurecom Spring 2018 - Prof. B. Huet

## [Lab 1](https://github.com/intv0id/DeepLearning/blob/master/Lab1/Lab1.ipynb) - DL basics

Implements a Neural network using numpy. This aims to recognize handwritten digits (MNIST) using a 1-hidden-layer NN.

## [Lab 2](https://github.com/intv0id/DeepLearning/blob/master/Lab2/Lab2.ipynb) - LeNet-5

Implement the LeNet-5 Convolutionnal Neural Network and improvements such as NN head replacement.

## [Lab 3](https://github.com/intv0id/DeepLearning/blob/master/Lab3/Lab3.ipynb) - VanillaNN / GRU

Implement GRU Neural Networks as alternatives to LSTM and compate it on sentiment analysis to VanillaNN
